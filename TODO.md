# TODO

What I would like to see in my Timetrap fork?

## New Features

 - [ ] 'gist' - as 'display' but uploads the result to http://gist.github.com
 - [ ] 'add'- adds time entry directly
 - [ ] 'push' - push DB file to GIT repository

## Adjustments

 - [ ] fix conflicts with RVM - executable shouldn't depend on current RVM settings
 - [ ] 'display - print IDs by default
 - [ ] 'edit' - when 'editing', time entries have context of former times
 - [ ] remove 't' executable - rather alias it manually by user
